# Connecting To Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
When you're deploying locally, without any CI/CD to EKS, you'll need to authenticate from your local terminal.

Once you authenticate to EKS from your local terminal, a kubeconfig gets stored on your computer. The kubeconfig has all of the connection information and authentication needs to connect to EKS.

## Connecting to EKS
1. Show EKS in your AWS account
`aws eks list-clusters --profile *your_profile*`

2. Add cluster to your local kube context
`aws eks --region *your_region* update-kubeconfig --name *name_eks_cluster* --profile *your_profile*`

3. You can now check check /home/*your_user*/.kube/config and see if the cluster has been added to your local kube context.

4. Finally, you can execute some command to be sure there is communication to EKS
`kubectl get nodes`
