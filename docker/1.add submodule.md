# Add Python Application Submodule
In a working environment, Infrastructure DevOps do not need to take much care about the app code. This will be given by developers. In this repo https://github.com/AdminTurnedDevOps/Python-Sample-Application is the sample application code required. Here we are going to add to the repo as submodule.

A git submodule, in its essence, is a reference to another git repository. Itâ€™s a great way to include vendor code (like plugins or themes) into your own code base.

## Add submodule
```
git submodule add https://github.com/AdminTurnedDevOps/Python-Sample-Application docker/app
git add . 
git commit -m "adds uber-python-app submodule to docker/app"
```
Done this, we will already have the code linked to our repo and we will be able to use it to inject it inside the docker image.
